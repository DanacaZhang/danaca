**SUMMARY**                              
> As a UX designer I transform thorny problems into elegant solutions through user centered design, rapid prototyping and interaction skills. I have gained excellent research and analytical skills to apply to UX design through my experience in finance. I've also been trained on pencil sketching and oil painting since a young age which has improved my eye for visual presentations.
